    """
    This function optimizes the Collatz conjecture 
    for a given range of numbers between m_start and m_end
    and returns the number of steps to reach 1.

    Optimization 1:
    Stores the steps for each m in the cache, so that the pre-computed value can be reused
    next time it comes across the number. This will speed up performance.

    Optimization 2:
    Any number which is a power of 2 will always be even when divided by 2 and will always reach 1. 
    By taking the log 2 of these numbers, the performance will speed up. The log gives 
    the number of divisions required to reach 1, which is same as number of steps required to reach 1. 

    Optimization 3:
    Since an odd number when multiplied by 3 and added by 1 results to a even number, 
    it can further be divided by 2 in the same step hence skipping one loop iteration 
    but still maintaining the steps.
